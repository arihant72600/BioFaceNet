## Instructions

Pytorch Implentation of BioFaceNet: Deep Biophysical FaceImage Interpretation

The code is mostly located in CNN.ipynb

The training code is also downloaded to cnn.py for training without using the notebook.

My data can be downloaded from here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--7kZSMii5rhZEuiM1Wk3IawkVVs_BlB/view?usp=sharing

This should be put in a folder lableled data to run the training script.

Or the original data can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UMiaw36z2E1F-tUBSMKNAjpx0o2TePvF
and placed in the data_creation folder. Then the python notebook in data_creation would need to be run to create the data.

A pretrained model can be downloaded form here:

model_v3.pth has was trained with a higher specularity loss, whereas model.pth was trained with a lower specularity loss.
